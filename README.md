# Interpretable machine learning for prediction of aircraft turnaround durations

This repository contains the main points from my thesis where I present a model which predicts turnaround durations of an aircraft and also provides interpretability for the predictions. Predictions are made with a machine learning algorithm XGBoost and interpretability is provided with interpretability framework SHAP.

**Main components/technologies:**
- Pandas
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- 

All scripts are running on an Ubuntu VM in Google Cloud (Compute Engine)
Pandas is used in the data processing
Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database
Visualizations are drawn with Seaborn/Matplotlib
Cron schedules the execution of database and notebook update scripts
