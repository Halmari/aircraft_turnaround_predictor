# Interpretable machine learning for prediction of aircraft turnaround durations

This repository contains the main points from my thesis where I present a model which predicts turnaround durations of an aircraft and also provides interpretability for the predictions. Predictions are made with a machine learning algorithm XGBoost and interpretability is provided with interpretability framework SHAP.

**Main technologies used in the process:**
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SHAP
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

The link for the thesis will be provided after it is available in the university library site.
